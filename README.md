From playing with Lisa's game, I was interested in the probability of winning. 
Coded into an app. 
Added the options of different number of bridges and animals to see the probability of winning for different varations. 
The probability of winning the actual game is a third. 
Checking with Lisa's parents, "This sounds about right - but don't you have proper work to do?"
